## Lecture (Use the Computer App)

### Exercise 1
- Create a "myName" route that takes a name in the URL and returns a response with "my name is: [NAME]".
- Create a "total" route that takes two integers in the URL and returns a response with "The sum of both numbers are: [SUM]"

### Exercise 2
Using the Computer model/schema create 3 entries using 3 different methods (admin site, create method using an endpoint, and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all computer name entries and create a new endpoint to change the number of cores of all computers with a speed 3 or greater (GHz) to be "9".

### Exercise 3
Using the same project/app from Exercise 2, create a django template for the route URL. Do the following in the template:
- Display your name in large letters at the top
- Display all entries in the database as an HTML list
- Display "Here are all of the computers with a speed greater than 3 (GHz)"
- Display all computers with a speed greater than 3

## In Class Practice (Use the Phone App)

### Exercise 1
- Create a "add5" route that takes an argument in the URL and returns a response with "Your number plus 5 is: [ANSWER]"
- Create a "name3times" route that takes an argument in the URl and returns a response with the name printed 100 times.

### Exercise 2
Using the Phone model/schema create 3 entries using 3 different methods (admin site, create method using an endpoint, and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all phone name entries and create another new endpoint to change the hours of batter life of all phones with a version higher than 5 to be "247".

### Exercise 3
Using the same project/app from Exercise 2, create a django template for the route URL. Do the following in the template:
- Display your name in large letters at the top
- Display all entries in the database as an HTML list
- Display "Here are all the all phones with a version higher than 5"
- Display all phones with a version higher than 5
